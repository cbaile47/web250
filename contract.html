		<h2>Course Contract</h2>
		<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Connor Bailey</a>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2024, WEB250-N801, Database Driven Websites with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
		
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
		
		<p>Signed: Connor Bailey, 1/14/2024</p>
